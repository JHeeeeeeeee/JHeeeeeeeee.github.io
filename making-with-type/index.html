        <div class="introcol">Assess the integrity of the bridge structure, including beams, decks, supports, piers, and foundations, for any signs of cracks, fractures, deformation, or corrosion. Evaluate the condition of the materials constituting the bridge, such as concrete and steel, for indications of corrosion, cracking, peeling, or other forms of degradation. Determine the bearing capacity and stability of the bridge under both current and anticipated future loads, encompassing vehicle weight, foot traffic, wind load, snow load, etc. Examine the stability of bridge foundations, including piers and pile foundations, with respect to soil erosion, foundation settlement, and water erosion.</div>

            <div class="introcol"> Analyze the bridge's response and seismic resistance, especially important in earthquake-prone areas, to understand how the structure might behave during seismic events. Assess the durability of various bridge components, predict potential future deterioration, and identify maintenance and reinforcement needs. Ensure that the bridge's functionality aligns with design and usage requirements, including traffic safety, pedestrian accessibility, and drainage system efficiency. Also, consider the impact of environmental factors, such as water flow, wind speed, and temperature changes, on the bridge structure.</div>
